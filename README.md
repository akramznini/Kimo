## Project Description

The Kimo project aims to develop a peer-to-peer car rental application, allowing car owners to rent their vehicles to other users. This application will be available on both Android and iOS platforms and will be developed using the Flutter framework. The project will cover the entire architecture, from the backend to the frontend, to produce a functional prototype.

## Objectives

1. Develop an intuitive user interface: The app will offer a smooth and easy-to-navigate user experience, suitable for both iOS and Android.
2. Design a robust architecture: The app's backend will be designed to securely manage transactions and user data.
3. Create a functional prototype: The project will result in the creation of an operational prototype of the application.

### Features

- Payment systems
- Reservation management
- Ratings and reviews

## Plan

The project development will be divided into several phases:

- Phase 1: Research and Planning – Market study, definition of user needs, and detailed planning of features.
- Phase 2: UI/UX Design – Creation of wireframes and initial prototypes for validation.
- Phase 3: Development – Coding of features using Flutter for the frontend and selecting an appropriate solution for the backend (e.g., Firebase).
- Phase 4: Testing and Deployment – Integration and usability testing, bug fixing, and deployment of the application on the respective platforms.
